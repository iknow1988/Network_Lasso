# Network_Lasso

We want to use Network Lasso formulation to solve
Support Vector Machine (SVM) based binary
classification problem using Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in a distributed
style as described in [1]. Our prime focus is to do
binary classification of finding ‘good’ or ‘bad’
customer of a real-world Credit Card transactions
dataset. The dataset is collected from USCD Data
Mining Contest, 2009.
